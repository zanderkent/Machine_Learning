This is an "production ready" implementation that you can use to run a full Bayesian optimization
USE AS IS.

In order to run this you need to modify the get_data() function in helper_functions.py for your data.

If you want to add a custom evaulation function modify the code as neccesary. If you don't, go into the main.py and remove the custom functions that I've called.

Then you just need to run python main.py
